# **JAlgo** 
## Java Algorithm Library

JAlgo is a library meant to be used as an example for the most common algorithms and data structures.
The main usage of this library is an educational one.

The examples are (or will) be well documented in their respective Javadoc's.
The more difficult code parts should have some explanatory comments associated in the code.
Those "less obvious" code samples should also be well covered by unit tests as there is no point in giving examples that are buggy.
